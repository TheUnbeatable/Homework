I intend to finish this list before the end of 2017

The plan seem to be working out quite well, despite three hardest problems, I've finished all the rest.

Another list is added and still I hope to finish it before 2017 (which is quite difficult to achieve).

Gained 400 = 100 + 100 + 0 + 100 + 70 + 30 points in NOIP.

It is far less than anticipated, I could have done better if I weren't so disconcerted before the contest.

Anyway I'll keep on trying. Now I've got to devote all my time into Physics and Politics.

One day I shall return.

Whenever I click on a problem.
```cpp
  if (I gets the solution) {
    solve it in less than an hour;
  } else {
    learn how to solve it;
  }
```
